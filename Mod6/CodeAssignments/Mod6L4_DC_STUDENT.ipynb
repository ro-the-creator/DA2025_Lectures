    "## Mod 6 Lecture 4 Data Challenge:  Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Run a simple linear regression (SLR) on the NYC Yellow Taxi Dec 2023 excerpt to explain how a single input (X) relates to Tip % (Y). Practice picking a sensible X, fitting the line, and interpreting β₁, p‑value, and 95% confidence interval—plus basic assumption checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "We are looking at ONE month's worth of data (December 2023 to be exact).  Remember the data dictionary is found [HERE](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2023-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/4b4i-vvec/about_data)"

    "\n",
    "#### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pick an X with a plausible relationship to Tip % that is available at trip time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Communicate β₁ with units, p-vale, and a 95% CI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Tip %` is `tip_amount / fare_amount`. Choosing `fare_amount` as X can create a built‑in relationship because it’s in the definition of Y (mathematical coupling). Encourage alternative X’s like `trip_distance`, `pickup_hour (as numeric)`, or `passenger_count`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linearity check: Is the relationship roughly straight‑line? If X is discrete (e.g., passenger_count), SLR still works but discuss meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intercept meaning: If X=0 is unrealistic (0 miles), say the intercept is just a mathematical anchor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outliers: Large distances/fares can dominate. Consider trimming extremes thoughtfully or explaining how you would handle outliers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Critical thinking prompts as you work through the challenge (be prepared to answer at the end):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which input would you use to make a decision before the ride starts? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If β₁ is tiny but the p‑value is very small, is that useful for the business?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If residuals (can only get residuals after fitting the model) \"fan out\" as X grows, what story might that tell about tipping behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Would your conclusion change if you looked at daytime vs. late night rides separately?"
